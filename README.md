# Challenge 1 - Code Refactor
Week 1 - Columbia Boot Camp

## Description:

1. Changed semantic elements to create logical flow and organization to the HTML
2. Made corresponding changes in CSS to target appropriate elements instead of using classes when valid
3. Added alt attribute to image by:
- adding a new class for the image {class="hero.img"}
- removing image from CSS class "hero"
- adding image, alt attribute description, and class=hero.img in HTML
- adding an overflow property to {class="hero"} to create a container that holds the image
- defined the image properties to fit correctly within container
4. Changed the heading attributes in the footer of HTML from h2 to h4 to correct sequential order, and changed the definition of footer h2 in CSS to footer h4 to correspond with HTML
